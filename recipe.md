Line a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper and coat with nonstick spray
Puree the strawberries. Set aside a portion for the cake and for the strawberry cream cheese frosting.
Whisk together the dry ingredients. In another bowl, whisk the wet ingredients.
In a stand mixer, cream the butter until fluffy, then add the sugar and cream again. Stop the mixer and add the egg whites, then beat until incorporated. Add the whole egg, mixing until combined.
Time to alternate! Slowly add half of the dry ingredients, then the wet ingredients, then the remaining dry ingredients. Stop mixing as soon as the flour disappears.
Pour the batter into the cake pan, smoothing the top. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 30 to 35 minutes. Let it cool completely.
Prepare the frosting: Using a stand mixer, beat the butter, cream cheese, and strawberry puree, then slowly beat in the powdered sugar. Increase the speed, and beat until smooth. Don’t overbeat it!
To frost: Place the cake on a serving plate. Spread the frosting generously all over the cake, and garnish with fresh strawberries.
Refrigerate until you’re ready to serve. When you want to serve it, let it sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes (you can taste flavors more fully if the cake isn’t ice cold). 
ENJOY!
